title: Hello World

Welcome to my [GitHub Page](https://jychstar.github.io/). Thanks to GitHub founders and open-source developers over the world, I have a free space that hosts the free expressions of my thought.

I am so excited to dive into the world of computing and I can't wait to learn more! Since 2016 June, I have been blogging in http://www.yuchao.us to organize new knowledge and acquired skills. That's a lot of fun and a feeling of achievement.

In the future, I will organize my codes in https://github.com/jychstar. And this page is reserved for discussion of my codes.

By the way, I generated this GitHub page by [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). The detailed steps are recorded in http://www.yuchao.us/2016/07/my-github-page.html
